something more meaningful... ;-)

INSTALL MISSING GEMS

As a basic requirement, you have to install missing gems required by the
template (this task is implemented individually for each template):

  sudo rake template:gems

!!Attention: Whenever you want to install additional gems, be sure to use
"appcfg.rb gem" provided by the Google AppEngine JRuby tools and not "jgem" as
Google maintains a local repository per project and bundles the files to
upload from that information. You will run into missing gems on the server if
you bypass this!

GOOGLE APPENGINE DEPLOYMENT

Deploy the application with

  rake appengine:deploy

and open

  http://{{name}}.appspot.com

to have a first test.

Be sure to set the version number in the AppEngine::Rack.configure_app part
of "config.ru" to a new value, when you are experimenting with an unstable
version and don't want to risk your users getting exceptions.

You can try the new version by opening e.g.

  http://3.latest.{{name}}.appspot.com

and replacing "3" with the version number you want to run.

Switch the application to the new version as default (stable version) by
opening

  http://appengine.google.com/deployment?&app_id={{name}}

and setting a new default.

SOME MORE INFO

- Gems installed with "appcfg.rb gem" reside in directory ".gems". Again: Do
  not use "jgem" at all!

- Some gems will throw exceptions during bundling: Have a look for paths
  assembled using ".." to reach the parent directory and replace with
  File.dirname(...). Retry and be a good citizen and send in the patch the
  developer of that gem... ;-)

- Data uploaded to the server is gathered in directory "WEB-INF" as with any
  Java project. The first time "rake appengine:run" or "rake appengine:deploy"
  is called, this directory will be created and "jruby-rack-xx.jar" is
  downloaded from its homepage.
  
  The first call to "rake appengine:run" or "rake appengine:deploy" with 
  downloading the rack jar will fail. Just ignore and retry.

- "WEB-INF/lib/gems.jar" is only created or updated after a call to
  "appcfg.rb gem". This is enforced by "rake appengine:deploy" but not by
  "rake appengine:update".
