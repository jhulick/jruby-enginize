README

This is a generic README generated by jruby-enginize. Please replace with
something more meaningful... ;-)

DEVELOPMENT

You can start a local development server by running the following command:

  rake appengine:run

Whenever you want to require additional gems, be sure to add them to the
bundler configuration in "Gemfile" instead of using jgem: The Google tools
maintain a local repository per project and bundle the files to upload from
that information.

GOOGLE APPENGINE DEPLOYMENT

Deploy the application with

  rake appengine:deploy

and open

  http://{{name}}.appspot.com

to test it live.

Be sure to set the version number in the AppEngine::Rack.configure_app part
of "config.ru" to a new value, when you are experimenting with an unstable
version and don't want to risk your users getting exceptions.

You can try the new version by opening e.g.

  http://3.latest.{{name}}.appspot.com

and replacing "3" with the version number you want to run.

Switch the application to the new version as default (stable version) by
opening

  http://appengine.google.com/deployment?&app_id={{name}}

and setting a new default.

SOME MORE INFO

- Gems have to be added to bundler config in "Gemfile". Again: Do not use
  "jgem" at all!

- Some gems will throw exceptions during bundling: Have a look for paths
  assembled using ".." to reach the parent directory and replace with
  File.dirname(...). Retry and be a good citizen and send in the patch the
  developer of that gem... ;-)

- Data uploaded to the server is gathered in directory "WEB-INF" as with any
  Java project. The first time "rake appengine:run" or "rake appengine:deploy"
  is called, this directory will be created and some gems will be downloaded.

- Java stuff is bundled in "WEB-INF/lib/gems.jar" on the fly. You might want
  to enforce a rebuild from time to time by calling "rake appengine:rebundle".

- Sometimes the local test server keeps running after Ctrl-C, so have a look
  at "ps" and manually kill the process if needed.

- If you get something like the following error message

    Permission denied - ~/.appcfg_rb_nag (Errno::EACCES)

  you need to remove that file with "rm ~/.appcfg_rb_nag" or at least change
  ownership as it was created earlier with starting an app with "sudo".
