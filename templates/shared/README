GOOGLE APPENGINE DEPLOYMENT

As a basic requirement, copy and split the JRuby-JAR calling

  jrake jruby:splitjars

once and after each upgrade to a new version of JRuby.

Deploy the application with

  jrake appengine:deploy

and open

  http://{{name}}.appspot.com

to have a first test.

Be sure to set the version number in "appengine-web.xml" to a new value, when
you are experimenting with an unstable version and don't want to risk your
users getting exceptions.

You can try the new version by opening e.g.

  http://3.latest.{{name}}.appspot.com

and replacing "3" with the version number you want to run.

Switch the application to the new version as default (stable version) by
opening

  http://appengine.google.com/deployment?&app_id={{name}}

and setting a new default.
