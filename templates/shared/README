GOOGLE APPENGINE DEPLOYMENT

!!Attention: As a basic requirement, the JRuby archive "jruby-complete.jar"
has to be placed in the "lib" directory of your app and this is way to large
to include it in the generator. If you have this file on your disk, copy it
over and be sure to rename it to "jruby-complete.jar". If missing, the
deployment will download the file for you. Expect a 10 MB download (only done
once).

Deploy the application with

  jrake appengine:deploy

and open

  http://{{name}}.appspot.com

to have a first test.

Be sure to set the version number in "appengine-web.xml" to a new value, when
you are experimenting with an unstable version and don't want to risk your
users getting exceptions.

You can try the new version by opening e.g.

  http://3.latest.{{name}}.appspot.com

and replacing "3" with the version number you want to run.

Switch the application to the new version as default (stable version) by
opening

  http://appengine.google.com/deployment?&app_id={{name}}

and setting a new default.
